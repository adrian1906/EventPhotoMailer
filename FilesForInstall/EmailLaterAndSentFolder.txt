The folders EmailLater and Sent are used by EPE to hold image files

EmailLater is used to tempararily hold image files whose filenames contain the email addresses.

The Sent folder is the final destination for files that have been successfully sent.

The reason this file is sitting inside each folder is because it appears that the installer
needs a file in each folder in order to create the folder during installation.
